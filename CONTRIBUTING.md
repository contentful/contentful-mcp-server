## 🛠️ Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- npm
- A Contentful account with a [Space ID](https://www.contentful.com/help/spaces/find-space-id/)
- [Contentful Management API personal access token](https://www.contentful.com/help/token-management/personal-access-tokens/)

### Setup Steps

1. **Fork the repository**

   ```bash
   # Fork on GitHub, then clone your fork
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/contentful-mcp-server.git
   cd contentful-mcp-server
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Build the project**

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. **Configure the MCP server in your IDE**
   Below is a sample configuration for Cursor:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "contentful-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "<your_full_path_to_the_package>/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "CONTENTFUL_MANAGEMENT_ACCESS_TOKEN": "your-CMA-token",
        "SPACE_ID": "your-space-id",
        "ENVIRONMENT_ID": "master",
        "CONTENTFUL_HOST": "api.contentful.com"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Testing with MCP Inspector

For local development and testing:

1. **Set up environment variables** - Create a `.env` file in the project root:

   ```bash
   # Copy the example environment file
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your Contentful credentials
   ```

2. **Run the inspector** - The MCP Inspector runs in your browser for interactive testing and automatically loads environment variables from your `.env` file.

   To run the inspector with logs:

   In one terminal:

   ```bash
   npm run logs:watch
   ```

   In another terminal:

   ```bash
   npm run inspect:watch
   ```

   Alternatively, run the inspector without seeing logs:

   ```bash
   npm run inspect
   ```

### Linting

```bash
npm run lint
npm run lint:fix
```
